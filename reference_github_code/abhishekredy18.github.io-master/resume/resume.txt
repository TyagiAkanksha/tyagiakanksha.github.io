PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Remote, USA
VIGILANT INC.​
Artificial Intelligence Engineering Intern​
Jun 2025 – Aug 2025
●​ Designed and deployed a FastAPI microservice for the GENIE ML-Deduplicator, enabling real-time processing of incoming
alerts through ingestion, deduplication, and health monitoring endpoints.
●​ Built a multi-stage deduplication pipeline combining static filters, transformer embeddings, DBSCAN clustering, and
semantic similarity checks, integrated with Postgres, pgvector, and PostGIS to ensure high-quality, unique alerts.
●​ Automated embedding workflows with Hugging Face models and containerized the system with a multi-stage Dockerfile,
delivering reproducible, cloud-ready deployments for scalable production use.
MOBILITY RESEARCH (IIIT-H Affiliated)
​
Hyderabad, India
Research Assistant Advisor: Dr. Girish Varma​
May 2023 – Jun 2024
●​ IDD-AW : Robust Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving in Adverse Conditions:
○​ Developed the large-scale IDD-AW dataset (5000 RGB-NIR images) for semantic understanding of Indian driving
scenes under adverse weather (rain, fog, snow, lowlight).
○​ Introduced the novel "Safe mIoU" metric to enhance safety evaluation of segmentation models by penalizing critical
misclassifications overlooked by traditional mIoU.
○​ Built SB3-based reinforcement learning models in SUMO to optimize lane selection and vehicle-to-vehicle
communication, reducing emergency vehicle traversal times and surpassing human traffic strategies.
●​ Published "Idd-AW: A Benchmark for Safe and Robust Segmentation of Drive Scenes in Unstructured Traffic and Adverse
Weather" in the Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), Jan. 2024.
ACADEMIC PROJECTS
Machine Learning Based Characterization of Chemical Ordering in High Entropy Oxides (CMU)​ May 2025 – Present
Advisor: Dr. Simon Gelin​
●​ Train and evaluate equivariant ML models (e.g., Allegro, NequIP) for atomic-scale energy and force prediction to accelerate
materials discovery.
●​ Perform Monte Carlo simulations to equilibrate HEO-J14 configurations across temperatures and assess chemical ordering.
TrackAnything: Multi-modal Promptable Tracking in 3D (CMU) ​
Jan 2025 – Apr 2025
●​ Developed an ML model to generate 3D bounding boxes from text prompts (e.g., “walking between parked vehicles”) and
video, enabling scenario mining in autonomous driving with the Argoverse 2 dataset.
●​ Integrated LiDAR, map, and vehicle pose data using a transformer-based architecture inspired by PromptTrack.
●​ Enhanced scenario mining for self-driving applications by improving object tracking accuracy in urban environments.
Real-time Pedestrian Detection and Safety Alert System (CMU)​
Jan 2025 – Apr 2025
●​ Designed a real-time pedestrian detection and safety alert system using NVIDIA Jetson Nano, with YOLO & MobileNet
SSD models trained on CityPersons and Caltech datasets.
●​ Optimized edge AI inference with quantization, pruning, and TensorRT, leveraging DeepStream for urban traffic safety.
●​ Developed an intelligent safety alert mechanism that triggers audio-visual alerts when pedestrians enter the road during
restricted signals and flashes warning signals for speeding vehicles at red lights in real-time.
Smart City Sensor Network Anomaly Detection (CMU) ​
Sep 2024 – Dec 2024
●​ Designed a graph neural network to model relationships across IoT sensors (traffic, air quality, and energy meters) for
anomaly detection in urban infrastructure.
●​ Detected spatio-temporal anomalies like faulty sensors and abnormal traffic surges, improving smart city reliability.
