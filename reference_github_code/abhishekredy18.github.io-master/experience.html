        <ul>
            <li>Designed and deployed a FastAPI microservice for the GENIE ML-Deduplicator, enabling real-time
                processing of incoming alerts through ingestion, deduplication, and health monitoring endpoints.</li>
            <li>Built a multi-stage deduplication pipeline combining static filters, transformer embeddings, DBSCAN
                clustering, and semantic similarity checks, integrated with Postgres, pgvector, and PostGIS to ensure
                high-quality, unique alerts.</li>
            <li>Automated embedding workflows with Hugging Face models and containerized the system with a multi-stage
                Dockerfile, delivering reproducible, cloud-ready deployments for scalable production use.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>IDD-AW : Robust Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving in Adverse Conditions:</strong>
                Developed the large-scale IDD-AW dataset (5000 RGB-NIR images) for semantic understanding of Indian
                driving scenes under adverse weather.</li>
            <li>Introduced the novel "Safe mIoU" metric to enhance safety evaluation of segmentation models by
                penalizing critical misclassifications overlooked by traditional mIoU.</li>
            <li>Built SB3-based reinforcement learning models in SUMO to optimize lane selection and vehicle-to-vehicle
                communication, reducing emergency vehicle traversal times and surpassing human traffic strategies.</li>
            <li>Published "Idd-AW: A Benchmark for Safe and Robust Segmentation of Drive Scenes in Unstructured Traffic
                and Adverse Weather" in WACV, Jan. 2024.</li>
