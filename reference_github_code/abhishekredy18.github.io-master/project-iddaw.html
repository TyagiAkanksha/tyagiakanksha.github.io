        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Large-scale deployment of fully autonomous vehicles requires a very high degree of robustness to
            unstructured traffic, weather conditions, and should prevent unsafe mispredictions. While there are
            several datasets and benchmarks focusing on segmentation for drive scenes, they are not specifically
            focused on safety and robustness issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            We introduce the <strong>IDD-AW dataset</strong>, which provides 5000 pairs of high-quality images with
            pixel-level annotations, captured under rain, fog, low light, and snow in unstructured driving conditions.
            As compared to other adverse weather datasets, we provide:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>More annotated images</li>
            <li>Paired Near-Infrared (NIR) image for each frame</li>
            <li>Larger label set with a 4-level label hierarchy to capture unstructured traffic conditions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We benchmark state-of-the-art models for semantic segmentation in IDD-AW. We also propose a new metric
            called <strong>"Safe mean Intersection over Union (Safe mIoU)"</strong> for hierarchical datasets which
            penalizes dangerous mispredictions that are not captured in the traditional definition of mean Intersection
            over Union (mIoU). The results show that IDD-AW is one of the most challenging datasets to date for these
            tasks.

        <h2>Dataset Summary</h2>
        <p>
            IDD-AW is a groundbreaking dataset designed to address the challenges of autonomous driving in adverse
            weather conditions and unstructured environments. While existing datasets have primarily focused on
            well-organized, controlled settings, IDD-AW takes a different approach by capturing the complexities of
            real-world driving scenarios. The dataset is particularly unique for its focus on adverse weather conditions
            like rain, fog, snow and lowlight, collected in cities all across India.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Diverse Geographical Coverage:</strong> IDD-AW is collected across various states and terrains
                of India, from the highways of Hyderabad to the snowy hills of Manali and the foggy roads of Delhi and
                Ooty encompassing a range of road types, traffic densities, and adverse weather conditions like rain,
                fog, snow and lowlight.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Rich Annotations:</strong> The dataset includes both NIR and RGB paired components for each
                image and annotated for semantic and instance segmentation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>High-Quality Data:</strong> The dataset is meticulously curated, with high-resolution RGB and
                NIR camera sensors capturing over 1 million frames. However, through thorough inspection and high
                quality checks, the final dataset has shortlisted 5000 RGB-NIR image pairs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Unique Object Categories:</strong> Unlike other datasets that often generalize objects into
                broad categories, IDD-AW provides a more nuanced classification, including unique vehicle types and
                pedestrian behaviors commonly seen in unstructured environments and adverse weather conditions.
